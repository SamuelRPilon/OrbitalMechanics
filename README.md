# Orbital Mechanics Class Work

This repository contains all of the code that I wrote for my Orbital Mechanics class. During the class, we learned about the fundamental principles of spaceflight and how they are used to design and operate spacecraft in Earth orbit and beyond.

The code in this repository covers a wide range of topics related to orbital mechanics, including:

- Kepler's laws of planetary motion
- Orbital dynamics
- Orbital maneuvers
- Interplanetary trajectories
- Spacecraft attitude and control

In each folder, you will find code examples and exercises that I completed throughout the course. Some of the highlights of the repository include:

- **Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion**: In this section, I wrote code to simulate the motion of planets and other celestial bodies using Kepler's laws of planetary motion. I used numerical methods to solve the equations of motion for the positions and velocities of the objects in the system.

- **Orbital Dynamics**: In this section, I wrote code to analyze the dynamics of spacecraft in Earth orbit and other types of orbits. I calculated the parameters of the orbit, such as the eccentricity and inclination, and I used numerical methods to simulate the motion of the spacecraft over time.

- **Interplanetary Trajectories**: In this section, I wrote code to calculate the trajectories of spacecraft on interplanetary missions. I used numerical methods to solve the equations of motion for the spacecraft and the planets, and I optimized the trajectory to minimize the fuel required.

Overall, this repository provides a comprehensive collection of code examples and exercises that demonstrate the principles and applications of orbital mechanics. I hope that it will be a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about this fascinating field of study.
